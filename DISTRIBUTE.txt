Glad to hear that xv is still of use to someone. :)

One of the nice features of "never updated" software is that
(eventually) all the more obvious bugs get patched -- and the program,
while primitive by today's standards, probably *screams*. (It ran pretty
well on computers that were 10-100 times slower than today's hardware.)

New features? Pah! Who needs 'em?!?  :D


Yes, please, go ahead, patch it as needed and distribute it anywhere you
think is appropriate. (I no longer follow the Unix/Linux 'scene', so I
defer to your judgement on that.)
